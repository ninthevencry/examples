The position property allows you to specify the 
position of an element.

When set to relative, an element’s position is relative 
to its default position on the page.

When set to absolute, an element’s position is relative to 
its closest positioned parent element. It can be pinned to any 
part of the web page, but the element will still move with the 
rest of the document when the page is scrolled.

When set to fixed, an element’s position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.
When set to sticky, an element can stick to a defined offset position when the user scrolls its parent container.
The z-index of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.
The display property allows you to control how an element flows vertically and horizontally in a document.
inline elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually adjusted width or height.
block elements take up the width of their container and can have manually adjusted heights.
inline-block elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.
The float property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.
You can clear an element’s left or right side (or both) using the clear property.

The syntax for HSL is similar to the decimal form of RGB, 
though it differs in important ways. The first number represents 
the degree of the hue, and can be between 0 and 360. The second 
and third numbers are percentages representing saturation and lightness respectively.
    
color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);

To use opacity in the HSL color scheme, use hsla instead of hsl
Alpha is a decimal number from zero to one. If alpha is zero, 
the color will be completely transparent. If alpha is one, 
the color will be opaque. The value for half-transparent 
would be 0.5

color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1);

The RGB color scheme has a similar syntax for opacity, rgba. 
Again, the first three values work the same as rgb and the 
last value is the alpha

color: rgba(234, 45, 98, 0.33);

A little unconventional, but still worth mentioning is how hex 
colors can also have an alpha value. By adding a two-digit 
hexadecimal value to the end of the six-digit representation 
(#52BC8280), or a one-digit hexadecimal value to the end of 
the three-digit representation (#F003), you can change the 
opacity of a hexadecimal color. Hex opacity ranges from 00 
(transparent) to FF (opaque).

Alpha can only be used with HSL, RGB, and hex colors; we 
cannot add the alpha value to name colors like green.
