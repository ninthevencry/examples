##Form Validation
Modern websites require a lot of information from their users and they collect a lot of this information through HTML forms.
It’s essential to validate the data submitted through forms to keep websites secure and to make sure they function correctly.
Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define patterns to look for in text. They are an important tool used in validating input.
Modern HTML comes with useful built-in methods for form validation.
Custom and complicated client-side validation can be accomplished with JavaScript.
Asynchronous requests to the server can perform back-end validations before a form has been submitted.
A final back-end validation of all data is required to ensure an application’s security and sanitize all data.
